 Fruit Ripeness Detection System Using Gas Sensor and Arduino
=
Aim
=

To design and implement a system that detects the ripeness of fruits by sensing the gases emitted during ripening using an MQ135 gas sensor and displaying the result on an LCD.

Objective
=

The objective of this project is to detect the ripeness of fruits by measuring the gas concentration released during ripening using an MQ135 sensor and to display the ripeness status clearly on an LCD with visual indication through an LED.

Components Used
=
Arduino Uno MQ135 Gas Sensor 16×2 LCD Display LED Resistor Breadboard Connecting Wires USB Cable (for programming and power supply)

Implementation
=

The MQ135 gas sensor is interfaced with an Arduino to continuously monitor gas levels emitted by fruits. The sensor readings are compared with a predefined threshold, and based on this comparison, the ripeness status is displayed on a 16×2 LCD while an LED provides a quick visual indication.

Result
=
The system successfully detects the ripeness of fruits based on gas concentration levels. When the sensor detects higher gas levels, the LCD displays “Fruit is Ripened” and the LED turns ON. For lower gas levels, the LCD displays “Not Ripened” and the LED remains OFF. This confirms that the fruit ripeness detection system works effectively.
